## Description

This command line driven applicaiton will allow you to input the information for your team including
 - Name
 - Email
 - Employee ID
 - Their Role within your company
 - Depending on that role you will either see
 - GitHub information (Engineers)
 - Office Numbers (Managers)
 - School (Interns)

 It will then output it onto a nice HTML file that is easily viewable and accesible.

## Introduction 

For this project we were given no starter code at all. Just getting started on to it ive already realized we will have many pages associated with this applicaiton. 
We will have a main page that will help us to run the application with the prompted questions
> index.js
We will also have a JS page for our over all Parent class of Employee, as well has the children classes as well of Intern, Manager, and Engineer
> Employee.js Intern.js Manager.js Engineer.js
This application also requires to have test suites for each of those previous pages.

And lastly this will output an html into our output folder. 
> ./output/team.html

## Challenges
I started by creating my constructors first, which i know is backwards. I am still really struggling with the testing factor of how things go. I do have a session with my tutor today and i plan to have him really go into depth on how the testing process works. I didnt want to let that hold me up to much so i did end up at least pseudo coding out the constructors first.

## Victories

This is a very hefty project so far. It has included the most amount of hard coded seperate pages weve done yet. I knew this was going to be a big challenge for me. I started off with what was the most familiar to me. 

I just started to create my constructors. This was still extremely fresh in my mind as we had done a lot of it in class this weel already.

Next i knew that i was going to need templates for the HTML that was going to be generated. I decided to go with Bootstrap and use the cards. That seemed like the simplest options as well as what matched the mock up best.

I just created 3 seperate HTML files and put the basic bones of what each 'Roles' card would look like.
